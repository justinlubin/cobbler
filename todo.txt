- refactor lang_utils / normalize?
    - lang_utils.ml should have fully_beta_reduce and fully_case_reduce
    - normalize.ml should be called "fusion" and have pull_out_cases
    - then maybe synthesis.ml should define a function "norm" that does
      inline + fully_beta_reduce + fusion + fully_case_reduce
        - or maybe "fusion" should actually do the fully_case_reduce...
- higher-order unification
- recursive function to fold extraction
- fold fusion in normalization
