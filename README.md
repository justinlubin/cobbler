# Getting Started Guide

To evaluate this artifact, we recommend using the included virtual machine with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) v7.0.14. Other versions will likely
work, but this is the version that we tested the virtual machine with.

Once opened in VirtualBox, take the following steps to "kick the tire" of this
artifact:

1. Sign into the only user
2. Open the terminal
3. Run `cd ~/Desktop/cobbler`
4. Run `./cobbler`

If you see a welcome message, you should be good to go.
